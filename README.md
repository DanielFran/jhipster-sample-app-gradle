jhipster-sample-app-gradle
==========================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app-gradle/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app-gradle/latest)

This is a sample application created with [JHipster](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster), using the [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) option.

If you want the sample application created with the default settings (Maven instead of Gradle), you can find it [here](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app).

If you want to run the app, run Gradle with the Spring Boot plugin.

On Unix or Mac OS X:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

On Windows:

```bash
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

And open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Of course, if you are a true Java hipster, you should use the [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster)!
